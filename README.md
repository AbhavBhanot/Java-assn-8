1. **Student**: Represents the student object with ID, name, and age.
2. **StudentManager**: Manages the student list and provides CRUD operations.
3. **Main**: Contains the main method for demonstration and testing.
4. **DuplicateStudentException**: Custom exception for duplicate student entries.
5. **NoStudentsException**: Custom exception for empty student records.
6. **StudentNotFoundException**: Custom exception when a student is not found.

How to Run
----------
1. Copy all code into a single file named `Main.java`.
2. Open any online Java compiler (e.g., https://www.jdoodle.com or https://replit.com).
3. Paste the code and run the program.
4. Observe console output and take screenshots as needed.

Expected Output
---------------
- List of all students
